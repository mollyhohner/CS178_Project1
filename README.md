# CS 167 Project 1 Introduction
## Project Summary

This web application is a Flask-based user management system with basic CRUD functionality and city-based data lookup. Users can add their name and a city they want to visit, and the app stores this data in a database. It also includes features to update, delete, and display users, as well as a tool to find the country a city is located in.

Key features include:

* Add, display, update, and delete users (username + city)

* Store user data in AWS DynamoDB or SQL database

* Lookup a city and return the country itâ€™s located in

## Technologies used

* Python with Flask (web framework)

* HTML (to create templates)

* MySQL/AWS DynamoDB (database for storing user/city info)

* boto3 (for DynamoDB interaction)

* Flask Flash (for user messages and notifications)
